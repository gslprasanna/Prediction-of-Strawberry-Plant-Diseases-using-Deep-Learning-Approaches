# Prediction-of-Strawberry-Plant-Diseases-using-Deep-Learning-Approaches
In this project, we have developed the strawberry plant disease prediction  and classification application. This Application is very helpful for the farmers. By  using this application farmer can upload images of diseased plants and get the  prediction of the diseases of the main 5 strawberry plant diseases that we have implemented. After the user has uploaded the image the disease description and cure methods. The web application has a simple UI with four primary pages: home, expert, pesticide, and contact us.
# WEB APPLICATION

After training the model, we save the model file with the .h5 extension.  So, the second stage of the project is the implementation of the web application to predict strawberry plant diseases. 
We have used Html, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap for the front end of the website. We have used Flask and Python for the backend of the website. We have written the code in the spyder IDE. After running the app.py file in the project one URL will be generated. By pasting that URL in the browser the strawberry plant diseases detection and classification application will be started.

Figure 28: Home Page

 The above image shows the experts contact page. After the farmers got the prediction of the disease, description and the cure methods of the diseases if still the farmers have doubts and want to contact the experts such as botanists, horticulturists, agronomists, plant pathologists, and plant geneticists. So that farmers can contact those experienced people to get suggestions for prediction and cure of strawberry diseases. This page contains the scientists/ expertâ€™s image, Professional, Contact number and email.
5) Pesticides page

Figure 31: Pesticide Page
The above image shows the pesticides page of the website. After the farmers got the prediction of the disease, description, and the cure methods of the diseases if the farmers want to know about the different pesticides that cure of the predicted diseases. So, the farmers can visit this page and check the information of different pesticides for the different types of strawberry diseases.

6) Contact Us 
 
Figure 32: Contact Us Page

The above image shows the Contact Us page. This page contains the contact information of the website admin. It contains the mobile number, email, LinkedIn, and more. By using this page, the farmers/users can contact the admin of the website if they encounter any problem.
 7)  Disease Description and Cure Page
The above image is the disease description and cure page of all diseases. After the user has uploaded the image to the web application, the model will predict the disease and gives the disease description and cure methods of the predicted angular leaf spot disease. The website shows the description and the cure methods in three different languages English, Hindi, and Telegu.
